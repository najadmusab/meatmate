        Blog – Welcome to The Hearty Hen HouseA hen is a female chicken, a domestic bird valued worldwide for its eggs and meat. Hens are social animals that can be found in groups called flocks, and they are known for their ability to lay eggs, which they do almost daily once they are mature. They are characterized by their combs and wattles, have wings, but are poor fliers, and can be a source of food and fertilizer, according to Britannica Kids and Brainly.in.  
Role in the ecosystem and human use: Hens are raised for their eggs and meat, and they also help control pests by eating insects and can provide fertilizer for plants through their droppings. They can also help reduce food waste by eating scraps. 
Physical characteristics:<br> A hen is a bird with a relatively short, round body, covered in feathers, and equipped with wings, though they are not strong fliers. They also have a comb on top of their head and wattles hanging from their throat. 
Behavior: Hens are social animals that live in flocks and can form social bonds. They lay eggs in nests and, when they become "broody," will sit on them to keep them warm until they hatch, explains Wikipedia. 
Reproduction:<br> Hens can lay eggs without a rooster, but if a rooster is present, the eggs can be fertilized to hatch into chicks. A young female chicken is called a pullet before she starts to lay eggs. 
        Our goal is to build a convenient platform where customers and shop owners can connect seamlessly. 
        Thank you for choosing Chicken Port — where quality meets convenience, and every meal begins with trust.
